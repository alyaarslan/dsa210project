# Screen Time and Sleep Quality Analysis
**Author:** Alya Ayşe Arslan

## Motivation  
In today’s hyperconnected world, screen time has become an unavoidable part of daily life. From work and education to social media and entertainment, people spend hours on their digital devices. While this shift has increased productivity and convenience, concerns about its effects on mental and physical health — particularly sleep — have emerged. This project investigates the relationship between screen time and sleep quality by analyzing personal usage and health metrics collected from a Samsung smartphone using the Samsung Health platform. The goal is to understand whether excessive screen exposure correlates with poorer sleep, and if so, how this manifests across different sleep metrics.

## Research Question and Hypothesis
My goal is to answer the research question "Does increased screen time negatively impact sleep quality?". The null hypothesis (H₀) is that there is no significant relationship between screen time and sleep quality, and the alternative hyptohesis (H₁) is that increased screen time is associated with decreased sleep quality.

## Tools  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Python IDE):** Interactive data analysis & visualization.
- **Pandas:** For handling structured data (CSV).
- **Matplotlib:** For line plots, bar charts.
- **Seaborn:** For heatmaps, regression plots.
- **Numpy:** For numerical computations.  
- **Scipy:** For analyzing the relationship between variables in a statistical manner.
- **Samsung Health App:** For importing and analyzing sleep quality data.


## Data Sources  
-This project uses two different sources for personal data tracking to analyze the relationship between outdoor activity and sleep quality. By comparing these data sources, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and correlations between time spent outside and various sleep metrics. This approach provides an understanding of how daily activity levels influence rest and recovery. The data sources include:

- **Samsung Digital Wellbeing Data:**  
  - Tracks total time spent on screen per day.  
  - Represents device usage across apps and activities. 

- **Samsung Health Sleep Data:**  
  - Exported from the Samsung Health app. 
  - Includes sleep duration, sleep cycles (REM, deep, light sleep), and recovery metrics.
  - Used to assess the impact of outdoor activity on sleep quality.

- **Time Period:**  
  - The dataset spans from July 2024 to September 2024, covering several months to observe potential trends and correlations. 


## Methodology  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Examine daily screen time and sleep patterns.
   - Investigate potential trends between screen time and variations in sleep quality. 

2. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Apply correlation and regression models to assess the relationship between screen time and sleep quality. 
   - Determine whether increased screen time negatively impacts rest and recovery.

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Develop clear and informative charts to illustrate key findings.
   - Use visual representations to highlight trends and potential correlations.
